Yatimtaq,Afghanistan,1101000024,recoverable,resource,Current Field Developments,2020-08-17,"The Ministry of Mines & Petroleum (MoMP) in mid-August 2020 announced the successful drilling of the Yatimtaq 36 development well on the Yatimtaq Field (Amu-Darya Basin). The well was drilled to 1,600m, and follows on from the successful Yatimtaq A32 well, which was drilled earlier in 2020. Together, the two wells will bring the total production of the field up to 10.6 MMcfg/d, which supplies local industries. The two Yatimtaq wells are the first two successfully drilled under management of the MoMP in 40 years. The drilling was undertaken by the Chinese private company Xinjiang Zhengtong Afghanistan Technology Services Co. Ltd, registered in Afghanistan through a service contract. The Yatimtaq Field was discovered in 1961 and has productive clastic and carbonate reservoirs in the Cretaceous (Albian, Aptian and Hauterivian) and the Upper Jurassic.A gas reservoir study by McDaniel Associates of Afghanistan gas fields between 2011-2016, which included the Yatimtaq Field, concluded that the fields do not contain enough remaining gas (depleted after 50 years of continuous production) to provide fuel for 25-30 years to proposed large- to medium-sized independent power producers. McDaniel Associates gave the following 1C, 2C and 3C contingent resources figures (in Tcf) to Yatimaq (0.15, 0.20, 0.26)."

Juma,Afghanistan,1101000032,recoverable,resource,Current Field Developments,2019-11-01,"In October 2019 the World Bank Group approved a $98.8m financing package for two interlinked gas-to-power projects, namely Mazar-e-Sharif (58.6 MW) and Sheberghan (40 MW). Both would be sourced from existing gas fields located around Sheberghan in northern Afghanistan. The construction of a new 94.5 km gas pipeline from the fields to Mazar-el-Sharif is already underway although impeded by security issues. The financing package supporting the Sheberghan project features a US$12.8m guarantee from the International Development Association (IDA), while the remainder is for the Mazar-e-Sharif project. The latter includes a US$12m guarantee from IDA to backstop the ongoing payment obligation of the power utility Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS), and a US$23.8m senior loan. It also includes US$1.5m in client risk-management swap from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which will mobilise US$43.8m in parallel loans for the project as mandated lead arranger. In addition, MIGA is providing US$48.7m political risk insurance for the two private shareholders and a senior lender. The guarantees are expected to provide protection against the risks of breach of contract, expropriation, transfer restriction and currency inconvertibility, and war and civil disturbance, for a period of up to 15 years.Background: Earlier, in a US$120 million project from 2011-2016, USAID mapped out the stages for development of the Sheberghan gas fields to address the critical power shortage in Afghanistan. USAID supported drilling/rehabilitating of three gas wells (undertaken by TPAO), conducted a gas reservoir study to certify existing/producing field reservoir gas quantity, pressures and quality; and assisted the Afghan government to partner with the private sector to design, build and operate a central, expandable gas processing plant and associated pipelines. The project also encouraged the private sector to construct and operate a series of gas-fired power generation plants, starting with an initial 200 MW plant. These power plants would be built, owned and operated (BOO) as Independent Power Producers (IPPs). Afghan Gas Enterprise (AGE) would play a major role in supplying gas to the IPPs in collaboration upstream with private-sector gas exploration and production companies, mid-stream with private-sector processing companies and downstream by delivering processed gas (fuel) to the IPP.Gas reservoir studies of seven producing gas fields (Gerquduq, Khoja Gogerdak, Yatimtaq, Jangal-e-Kalan, Shakarak, Chekh Che, and Khoja Bolan), were conducted by McDaniel Associates. These studies showed that the seven fields do not contain enough remaining gas (depleted after 50 years of continuous production) to provide fuel for 25-30 years to proposed large- to medium-sized IPPs. A Contingent Resources Report, of the Juma/Bashikurd (to date undeveloped) gas field where the one new well and one existing well (Bashikurd #3) were drilled/tested. The test wells drilled by TPAO and earlier data from Russian test wells indicated that commercial amounts of natural gas were available and could be produced in the future from the Juma/Bashikurd field. The reserve study and data from the test wells also indicated that the gas structures/formations in the Juma-Bashikurd field would require advanced drilling and production techniques, meaning that commercial production would take five-seven years after an operational start to come onstream.McDaniel Associates have given the following 1C, 2C and 3C contingent resources figures (in Tcf): Jarquduq (0.02, 0.04, 0.10); Khoja Gogerdak (0.08, 0.12, 0.18); Yatimaq (0.15, 0.20, 0.26); Shakarak (0.00, 0.02, 0.04); Juma-Bashikurd (0.33, 0.58, 0.79); Khoja Bolan (0.07, 0.09, 0.13); and Jangali Kalan Chekhche ((0.64, 1.05, 1.50). <P />Separately USGS has assessed the undiscovered conventional, technically recoverable natural gas resources of northern Afghanistan at 15.7 Tcf. <P />Current operational work: World Bank documentation from September 2019 states that gas production facilities in two wells at the Yatimtaq field have recently undergone rehabilitation work with support from the ADB and are assessed to be in serviceable condition. Currently gas is produced from four fields (in production since the 1960s) - Jarquduq (10 Mcm/d); Khoja Gogerdaq (70 Mcm/d); Shakarak (80 Mcm/d), which has only one well in production; and Yatimtaq (150 Mcm/d). <P /><P /><P /><P /><P /><P /><P /><P />"

Juma,Afghanistan,1101000032,discoverydate,discovered,Current Field Developments,2019-11-01,"In October 2019 the World Bank Group approved a $98.8m financing package for two interlinked gas-to-power projects, namely Mazar-e-Sharif (58.6 MW) and Sheberghan (40 MW). Both would be sourced from existing gas fields located around Sheberghan in northern Afghanistan. The construction of a new 94.5 km gas pipeline from the fields to Mazar-el-Sharif is already underway although impeded by security issues. The financing package supporting the Sheberghan project features a US$12.8m guarantee from the International Development Association (IDA), while the remainder is for the Mazar-e-Sharif project. The latter includes a US$12m guarantee from IDA to backstop the ongoing payment obligation of the power utility Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS), and a US$23.8m senior loan. It also includes US$1.5m in client risk-management swap from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which will mobilise US$43.8m in parallel loans for the project as mandated lead arranger. In addition, MIGA is providing US$48.7m political risk insurance for the two private shareholders and a senior lender. The guarantees are expected to provide protection against the risks of breach of contract, expropriation, transfer restriction and currency inconvertibility, and war and civil disturbance, for a period of up to 15 years.Background: Earlier, in a US$120 million project from 2011-2016, USAID mapped out the stages for development of the Sheberghan gas fields to address the critical power shortage in Afghanistan.

Under the MoU, Excelerate will conduct a study to explore the potential of an integrated LNG-to-power solution that includes developing an LNG import terminal, converting and/or expanding the existing Vlora thermal power plant, and establishing small scale LNG distribution to Albania and the surrounding Balkans region. The Minister of Infrastructure and Energy said: “Supply diversification and the enhancement of supply security are crucial to Albania and to our Balkan neighbours as well. We are confident that LNG can be the key to achieving these strategic objectives and to finally providing a solution to the complex Vlora TPP project by choosing the best partners, equipped to deliver a project of such magnitude”. The pre-feasibility report is expected to be delivered in Q3 2021, while the targeted start-up for the LNG import project could be as early as 2023. Albania relies on hydropower plants, which can become unreliable during times of drought, to supply energy to the country's 2.8 million residents. LNG would bring reliable, affordable, and cleaner energy to the region and complement Albania's hydropower-based electricity production."

The production plan and budget failed to meet the two main objectives set by the three institutions: increase the production of the field and comply with strict environmental norms (concerning waste disposal and area rehabilitation), with investments in both areas deemed insufficient. An advisory committee formally rejected the plan on 29 July 2021. This comes after Albpetrol previously approved Bankers Petroleum's proposed 2021 work programme for the Patos-Marinza Field. Bankers intended to carry out infill drilling to increase output from around 12,000 bo/d to 13,500 bo/d. Bankers had experienced significant challenges during Q2 2020, when CEPSA suspended oil purchases from Albania during the height of Spain's Covid-19 outbreak; as a result, production only averaged 11,000 bo/d in H1 2020 but appears to have recovered during H2. At the time, Albpetrol reported disappointment with Sherwood International Petroleum's proposal for Kucova Field and asked the Canadian-owned company to return with an improved plan. "
